the sibling relationship of this then that

if this then show this

pick leg workout, then it opens up a dropdown of leg workouts then it opens up the rep fields
so add in to the next phase, the connection between linkedsiblings and the new operation system we are building. we want it to be like a "if then do" sorta thing when it comes to adding fields/instances/containers etc. and updating and deleting them as well, on top of the calculations for the derived fields. OR this might be a big overhaul but should go in the phase with the calculation. but we make it so a field can have an input and a derived if it wants. that way we can have like an incoming value (input or external), which can act as a trigger. does that make sense?






we should make the doc stuff like this:

like the stan lyrics, with the title and the text inside, that can be a container (will be container pill). inside that container can be instances (just the pills but smaller) and markdown text and media. surrounding the container is still the document. and it acts the same way it has been with how the text wraps around it. except when we drag it off, its a container now and not an instance. now instance pills can also be dragged inside of the container or outside of it inside the doc. so we have markdown text, container pills, and 2 sizes of instance pills (one for container and one for the doc), inside the doc. with the markdown text being able to be edited around those like it has been. inside the instances too, wont have a label but will display fields and then have a text section underneath that that holds markdown text. and then artifact section underneath that. does that make sense? so instances/and pills can be dragged in and out of docs, container pills, and containers. containers/and pills can be dragged in and out of panels, and docs.
