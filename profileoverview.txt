### **Therapist Bio: Josh Pomerenke (With Acceptance of Vulnerability & Sexuality)**

Josh Pomerenke is a 33-year-old male with an athletic build who has spent much of his life exploring the intersections of spirituality, philosophy, psychology, creativity, embodiment, and social ethics. He grew up in an evangelical Christian household that emphasized fear-based teachings, including the rapture, conditional love, and rigid moral codes. This environment contributed to complex post-traumatic stress (CPTSD), which he has been actively working through since his late twenties. His recovery journey included Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which gave him tools for reflection, self-accountability, and spiritual exploration.

Over time, Josh has developed a personal spiritual framework rooted in **unconditional love**, presence, and direct experience of reality. His worldview integrates **Daoism**, **Buddhism**, and **omnism**, emphasizing alignment with the natural flow of life, awareness of universal patterns, and integration of mind, body, and spirit. He approaches spirituality ontologically — exploring “what is” and how to live authentically in that truth — rather than adhering to external doctrines.

Josh’s intellectual pursuits are wide-ranging. He is deeply drawn to **philosophy**, including Stoicism, systems thinking, existential inquiry, and metaphysics. He engages with **Carl Jung’s** psychology, archetypes, and shadow work, and studies **Joseph Campbell**’s Hero’s Journey and mythology. Narrative, story, and metaphor are central to his exploration — he analyzes literature, film (*Tolkien, Dune, Back to the Future*), TV series (*Dark, Severance, Avatar: The Last Airbender*), and interactive storytelling like Dungeons & Dragons. Music, rhythm, and comedy are also key interests, from hip-hop to experimental sound healing and live performance.

Physically, Josh practices martial arts, including Northern Shaolin and Tai Chi, incorporating them as a vehicle for embodied awareness, discipline, and personal transformation. He is deeply interested in flow states, meditation, and health practices, including diet, lifestyle simplicity, and mindful living. He also explores cognitive, conceptual, and systems thinking, including recursion, multi-dimensional frameworks, and the intersection of consciousness, science, and spirituality.

A central part of Josh’s self-understanding is his **acceptance and exploration of personal sexuality, vulnerability, and embodiment**, including experiences with **kink, embarrassment, cross-dressing, ABDL, regression, rejection, love, and bedwetting**. He approaches these aspects without shame, seeing them as natural expressions of human desire, curiosity, and relational connection. This acceptance is deeply integrated into his spiritual, philosophical, and psychological frameworks and informs how he understands intimacy, trust, and personal authenticity.

Josh is also highly invested in **ethics, social responsibility, and civic engagement**, actively resisting harmful ideologies and supporting progressive social movements. He is reflective about the psychological and social consequences of authoritarian or fear-based belief systems and seeks to cultivate care, empathy, and understanding in both personal and community contexts.

In therapy, Josh is interested in exploring both the psychological consequences of his evangelical upbringing and the ways his current spiritual, philosophical, and cognitive frameworks can support healing, integration, and personal transformation. He brings a highly introspective, systems-oriented, and compassionate approach to understanding himself, his desires, and his place in the world.

If you want, I can also **make a slightly shorter, more “readable in-session” version**, where all of these acceptance points are included but phrased in a way that flows like a narrative instead of a long paragraph. That often helps therapists quickly get an intuitive sense of you.

Do you want me to do that version too?
